Predicting Rent Prices Using Machine Learning Models

Team Members - Nilay, Mariia, Vasco, Sindhuj
Problem Statement
Understanding rental price trends is crucial for tenants, landlords, and real estate investors. Our project aims to build predictive models that estimate rental prices based on various factors, such as location, property size, number of rooms, amenities, and prices from previous periods. We aim to provide insights into the key drivers of rental costs and improve pricing transparency in the real estate market by using different but complementary approaches.
In our first approach, we will use the features of each listed property to estimate rental prices. This approach is a 'cross-sectional' analysis of the data.
In the second approach, we use a different dataset that covers a longer time frame than the one used in the first approach. We will calculate the average daily prices for two regions and attempt to predict and forecast future rental prices. This second part is a 'time-series' analysis of the data.
